Function to find anagram

The function is very simple as first it will check the length between the two words if the length is not same then surely it is not anagram if the lengths do not even match and as for the logic after this is the simplest way to split the letters and sort it like if the word is "apple" then it will be split in and sort and the word will be "aelpp" then after both the words are split and sort then check if they match if both match then they are anagram if not then they are not anagram.

If considering the time complexity then splitting and sorting might take some time but space wise i think same as time when splitting and sorting will take extra memory.
Why I choose this method is that it was the first way that came to my mind and I won't mess up the function if I use this way. There are other way that I can learn to make it more time and space efficient.
